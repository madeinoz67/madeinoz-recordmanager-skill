#
# Country-Specific Taxonomy Definitions
# This file defines document types, tags, and retention rules for each country and domain
#
# HOW TO ADD A NEW COUNTRY:
# 1. Add a new top-level key with the country name (e.g., "Canada:")
# 2. Set the country property to the full country name
# 3. Define domains under the "domains:" key
# 4. Each domain should have: documentTypes, tagCategories, retentionRules
#
# HOW TO ADD A NEW ENTITY TYPE (DOMAIN):
# 1. Add a new key under "domains:" (e.g., "partnership:")
# 2. Define documentTypes as a list of document type names
# 3. Define tagCategories as categories with tag lists
# 4. Define retentionRules with years and legal reasons for each document type
#
# HOW TO ADD A NEW DOCUMENT TYPE:
# 1. Add the document type name to the documentTypes list
# 2. Add appropriate tags to relevant tagCategories
# 3. Add a retention rule with years and legal citation reason
#
# RETENTION RULES FORMAT:
# DocumentTypeName:
#   years: <number>  # Use 0 for "keep until event", 15 for "permanent/indefinite"
#   reason: "Legal citation or business reason for retention period"
#
# LEGAL CITATIONS SHOULD REFERENCE:
# - Australia: ATO requirements, Tax Administration Act, Fair Work Act, Corporations Act
# - United States: IRS regulations, state statutes
# - United Kingdom: HMRC requirements, FCA guidance, Consumer Rights Act
