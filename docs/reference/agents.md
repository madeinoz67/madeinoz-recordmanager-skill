## Safety Considerations

### Critical Safety Rules

#### 1. Deletion Auditor - MANDATORY for All Deletions
- **NON-NEGOTIABLE**: All deletion requests MUST route through Deletion Auditor
- **Adversarial Review**: Agent stress-tests every deletion request
- **Explicit Confirmation**: Requires specific approval phrase before execution
- **Audit Trail**: All deletion decisions logged for compliance
- **Risk Assessment**: Identifies potential data loss and business impact

#### 2. Compliance Validation
- **Retention Periods**: All deletions must pass retention period validation
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Documents must meet country-specific requirements
- **Trust Deed Compliance**: Trust documents follow special retention rules
- **Audit Trail**: Maintain comprehensive compliance documentation

#### 3. Sensitivity Protection
- **Automatic Classification**: New documents automatically scanned for sensitivity
- **Access Controls**: Sensitive documents flagged for appropriate access controls
- **Regulatory Compliance**: PHI, PII, and PCI data properly protected
- **Audit Trail**: All sensitivity classifications logged

#### 4. Archive Safety
- **Backup Requirements**: Critical documents must have appropriate backups
- **Migration Safety**: Archive migrations include rollback procedures
- **Access Preservation**: Ensure continued accessibility of archived documents
- **Compliance Alignment**: Archive strategies meet retention requirements

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Bypassing Deletion Auditor** for any deletion request
❌ **Using direct API deletion** without agent review
❌ **Ignoring agent warnings** about retention periods
❌ **Bulk deletions without individual review**
❌ **Skipping sensitivity classification** for new documents
❌ **Archive planning without compliance validation**

### Emergency Procedures

#### Document Deletion Emergency
1. **Immediate Halt**: Stop any deletion in progress
2. **Deletion Auditor Review**: Trigger immediate safety review
3. **Compliance Assessment**: Verify legal compliance
4. **Recovery Assessment**: Determine data restoration options
5. **Stakeholder Notification**: Alert relevant parties
6. **Documentation**: Complete incident documentation

#### Security Breach Response
1. **Sensitivity Scanner**: Immediate reclassification of affected documents
2. **Access Review**: Verify document access controls
3. **Compliance Guardian**: Assess regulatory implications
4. **Audit Trail**: Document all actions taken
5. **Preventive Measures**: Implement additional security controls

## Agent Usage Patterns

### Single Agent Usage
For focused tasks, invoke individual specialized agents for targeted assistance.

### Parallel Agent Usage
For comprehensive analysis, launch multiple agents simultaneously to provide complete coverage of different aspects.

### Sequential Agent Usage
For complex workflows, use agents in sequence where each agent builds upon the previous agent's work.

### Emergency Response
Critical safety situations trigger specific agent combinations with emphasis on security and compliance validation.
